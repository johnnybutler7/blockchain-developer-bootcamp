# Project Details

Decentralised web application as part of completing the blockchain developer bootcamp on Daap University - https://www.dappuniversity.com/bootcamp
As part of my learing I decided to develop the same application but using the latest version of Ruby/Rails(https://github.com/johnnybutler7/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-rails), this will form the basis of a blog post to compare the relevant technologies from my background/perspective.
More details coming soon.
